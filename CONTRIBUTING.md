# CONTRIBUTING.md

First and foremost, thank you for considering contributing to Parlay! Your contribution is valuable and we genuinely appreciate your interest. 

Parlay is a distinct software project developed by Snyk. Although separate from our core product line, it provides a platform for us to demonstrate our capabilities and some key concepts. 

Please note that we monitor and respond to issues and pull requests on a best-effort basis. 

### How to contribute

#### Code of Conduct

Prior to contributing, please familiarize yourself with our [Code of Conduct](CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md). We expect all our contributors to uphold these guidelines to maintain a respectful and inclusive environment.

#### Open Development

All development work on Parlay is done directly on GitHub. Both our core team members and external contributors send pull requests, which go through a unified review process.

#### Reporting Issues

We welcome you to raise an issue if you discover a bug, find a documentation error, or identify a feature you believe should be added. You can do this by opening a new issue in the issue tracker. Please ensure that your issue hasn't already been reported by reviewing existing issues before creating a new one. We value the time and effort you spend in providing these details.

#### Pull Requests

We highly recommend that contributors raise an issue before making a pull request. This allows us to discuss potential changes and prevent unnecessary or duplicative work. Once the issue has been reviewed and we've agreed on a solution, contributors can then fork the repository and submit a pull request.

##### Submitting your Pull Request

- Ensure your code passes all tests, and consider adding new tests for the changes you've made.
- In your Pull Request description, provide a detailed explanation of your changes. This assists us in understanding your decision-making process and aids in the effective review of your work.
- Remember to reference the relevant issue number in your pull request.

Your time and efforts make Parlay better, and we're grateful for your support and contributions. Thank you!
